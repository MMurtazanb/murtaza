#Paper is free!

Remembered this interesting anecdote -
A lady visited an architect and asked him to help design her dream house. She shared her needs and wants, the architect listened to her and scribbled a beautiful house design on a piece of paper. The lady was very happy to see this and loved the design. She asked how much do I pay, the architect said 10,000. The lady was surprised and said it is too expensive, she could pay him 1,000 which was more than worth for a few minutes of the architects time. The Architect looked at her and quickly erased the design and gave the paper, take it the Paper it free!

We encounter such instances where the person who is receiving has a different view of the worth we have. It is better to give them the paper for free!
