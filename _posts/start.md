*Now* is the best time ever to start!

I am going to get started with this on GitHub and reviwe some of my writing from other sites.

The content below was got me started to post and I feel it is a great start to begin here!
Yesterday when we were strolling, it was refreshing to have a conversation around what we like and what we do. In this time and age, there is so much we get to do, and from my list there were quite a few items that i like as well. This is a good place to be and i am grateful. 
She is a good friend so she reminded me of items I liked and which did not come up in the list; it is great to reflect and bring these back. So here i am with one, I love reading and had a habit of writing and sharing my thoughts. Now is the best time ever to get started, no time to waste!
I don't want to set limits on what i will write, but i will write often. 

Notes:
1. I am writing for myself
2. I have a point of view and opinion and respect that you as a reader may have a different one
3. At this time, i want to write and not have a conversation; so till a future date, which i don't know yet, i wont engage in comments

Smile more and often: and when i read this smiling, it has made my day!

#smile #noor
